# LEGO planters

This is a collection of OpenSCAD files for making 3D-printed pots for plants that have LEGO studs on the top surface so you can attach minifigures or any other LEGO piece to it.

The studs for all the files are all spaced so that any pair can be used for LEGO pieces.

If you're new to OpenSCAD, you can modify the files for new designs this way:

 - Change any of the parameters
 - Save or preview (F5) to see the 3D preview update

To generate an STL, you must first Render (F6) the model before you can Export (F7) it
